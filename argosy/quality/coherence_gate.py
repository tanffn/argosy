"""S22 — deterministic cross-surface coherence check.

A single concept (net worth, NVDA weight, FI margin, estate exposure) read off
multiple surfaces (body prose, dashboard, appendices) must carry the SAME value
everywhere — or those surfaces are contradicting each other. This catches the
class of defect that no per-surface specialist owns: NVDA 62.5% in the body vs
56.9% on the dashboard; the FI margin shown +118,020 on one surface and
-118,020 (sign-flipped) on another.

Coherence is a property of the whole artifact, so it is checked deterministically
over the AssembledArtifact's `surface_values` map, not eyeballed by an LLM.
