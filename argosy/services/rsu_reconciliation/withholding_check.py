"""§102 equity-tax payslip-reconciliation adequacy check.

This answers a single concrete question from a parsed Hilan payslip: **is the
§102 equity (RSU/ESPP) tax — withheld at sale by the trustee and reconciled
through your payslip — adequate for the equity income recognized this year?**

In Israel the §102 equity tax is withheld *at sale*: the §102 trustee/broker
deducts the advance tax from the sale proceeds (the same §102 tax the
``cash_source_reconciler`` sees as sale → Leumi USD wire *net of* tax). It is
then **reconciled through the monthly payslip** — if too much was withheld at
sale the employee is refunded the difference through payroll; if too little,
additional tax is taken through payroll. The payslip's YTD equity tax figure is
therefore the §102 equity tax *reconciled through payroll* on the equity income
recognized year-to-date.

The ground-truth model — confirmed against the real April 2026 payslip — is
that the payslip's §102 equity tax accounted YTD reconciles to the §102 trustee
model at the *wire* ordinary rate (50% top marginal, not the sim's conservative
62.17%):

    accounted_equity_tax  ==  capital_base * capital_rate(0.25)
                            +  ordinary_base * WIRE_ORDINARY_RATE(0.50)

mapping the parser's YTD fields as:

    ordinary_base  = ytd_non_fixed_gross          (§102 ordinary income base)
    capital_base   = ytd_capital_gain             (§102 capital income base)
    accounted_tax  = ytd_tax_on_non_fixed_gross   (§102 equity tax via payslip)

For April: 549,467*0.25 + 60,679*0.50 = 167,706.25 ≈ 167,707 (accounted). The
§102 equity tax accounted through the payslip therefore *reconciles* to the
§102 model at the 50% ordinary rate.

Adequacy vs reconciliation
--------------------------
Reconciliation only tells us the payslip accounts the §102 equity tax the model
predicts at the wire rate. The *final* filing liability for the ordinary
portion is computed at the conservative top-bracket rate (the sim's 0.6217,
which folds in National Insurance / health on the equity band). The §102 tax is
accounted at ~50% on the ordinary band but the conservative estimate is ~62%,
so the year-end filing can owe a top-up (or, if accounted exceeds it, a refund
— which itself flows back through your paycheck):

    conservative_liability = capital_base * 0.25 + ordinary_base * 0.6217
    potential_filing_topup = max(0, conservative_liability - accounted_tax)

That top-up is the honest "set this aside" number. If it is ~0 or negative,
the §102 tax accounted is adequate (a refund is even possible).

Scope honesty
-------------
This check verifies the §102 equity tax **reconciled through the payslip**
against the model. The at-sale advance itself (sale → Leumi wire, net of §102
tax) is captured by the existing ``cash_source_reconciler``. Both look at the
same §102 tax from different documents — the payslip is the
reconciliation / truth-up of what the trustee withheld at sale. This module
does not re-derive the at-sale advance; it only checks that the §102 equity tax
accounted through the payslip matches the model and flags the filing-time
top-up (or refund).

Read-only, deterministic, tolerance-based. No external deps; no UI/route
wiring (that is the next step).
