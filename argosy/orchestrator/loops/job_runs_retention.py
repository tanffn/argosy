"""``JobRunsRetentionLoop`` — daily ``job_runs`` retention + orphan reap.

Sprint A commit #9 (Spec A §2.1, §1.7).

Two complementary maintenance passes run inside one tick:

1. **Delete old ``status='ok'`` rows.** The audit table grows ~1 row per
   tick per registered job; at 14 loops firing minutely the table would
   reach ~6M rows in a year. ``status='ok'`` rows older than
   ``retention_days_ok`` (default 30 days) are deleted. ``status='error'``
   rows are KEPT FOREVER — the operator needs the historical failure
   trail for postmortems. ``status='skipped'`` + ``status='cancelled'``
   are also retained beyond the window (cheap; helps debug "why didn't
   this fire?" questions).

2. **Reap stale ``status='running'`` rows.** Per §1.7 failure matrix
   row "close fails, record_tick ok", a tick whose ``_close_job_run``
   raises leaves an orphan ``running`` row. This pass flips
   ``status='running' AND started_at < now - stale_running_hours`` (default
   24h) to ``status='cancelled'`` with ``error_message='reaped: stale
   running row'``.

   **LongRunningJob exclusion (codex review BLOCKER #1).** A
   :class:`LongRunningJob` supervisor's cycle row genuinely stays in
   ``status='running'`` for the duration of a connect cycle — a healthy
   Discord WS connection lasting >24h is the expected case, not a stalled
   tick. Reaping those rows would force-flip a live cycle to
   ``cancelled``, violating supervisor invariants. The loop accepts a
   ``long_running_names_fn`` callable that returns the current set of
   ``LongRunningJob`` names; rows for those jobs are EXCLUDED from the
   reap pass even when their ``started_at`` is beyond the 24h cutoff.
   The startup hook in ``argosy/api/main.py`` threads the registry's
   current set; tests pass an explicit set.

   The reap pass therefore targets only ``CadenceLoop`` orphan rows —
   the §1.7 matrix's "close-path failed" case for short ticks that
   should have closed within seconds.

At backend startup, :func:`reap_prior_process_job_runs` performs an immediate
third reconciliation before the scheduler starts. Under the single-backend
service model, every pre-existing ``running`` cadence receipt belongs to the
terminated process, so it is closed immediately rather than displayed as live
until the conservative 24-hour maintenance window expires.

Idempotent: a second tick in the same day finds no work and is a
no-op (DELETE / UPDATE against an empty result set). The cron is
``30 3 * * *`` (03:30 Asia/Jerusalem daily) — 30 minutes after the
backup loop's 03:00 snapshot so the backup captures the pre-retention
state.

Single-writer note: this loop writes to ``job_runs`` directly via
``UPDATE``/``DELETE`` — NOT through ``_open_job_run`` / ``_close_job_run``
because those helpers are for individual run rows, not bulk maintenance.
The single-writer regex sweep in ``test_jobs_registry`` allow-lists
``argosy/services/jobs/registry.py`` for INSERTs + ORM-constructor
patterns + helper calls; bulk maintenance via ``DELETE``/``UPDATE``
is OUTSIDE the single-writer contract (it doesn't INSERT new rows,
only prunes / marks existing ones).
